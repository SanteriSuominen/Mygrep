Thank you for using MyGrepProgram

This program is a command-line tool used to search for specific text patterns within files or input streams. It reads input line by line, 
checks if a line contains a match for a given search pattern, and outputs the matching lines.

How to use:

Windows example!

You will find .exe file in Mygrep/MyGrepProgram/x64/debug
Open CMD go to the .exe location in the debug file  example(cd c:/yourfiles/yourfiles/Mygrep/MyGrepProgram/x64/debug) " "yourfiles" depending where you installed my program"

when you are in debug location its time to run the program! :)

Command example: c:/.../x64/debug MyGrepProgram.exe -olori following c:/somefile/otherfile/textfile.txt

-olori		following		c:/somefile/otherfile/textfile.txt
Command	       search word	    Path to the file from where to search from

What are commands and how to use them:

Always put "-o" in beginning it means options otherwise your commands are ignored and result to unexpected behavior.

	[l] = adds line numbers. 1:lorem lipsum ...
	[o] = adds a message to the end that informs total lines where your search term was found or not found {LISTEN! NOT! SAME! AS! the frist o in -o how to uses correctly in command example [-olo] <-- correct way}
	[r] = reverse search flips the program on its head and outputs all the lines that dont include your search term all other commands are compatible with this mode.
	[i] = noCase ignores diffirence of lower and uppercase.

You can use multiple at the same time -ol -olo -ori.
Order doesnt matter you can write -olori -oorli -orilo.
